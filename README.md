# Port_Scanner
This is my take on creating a port scanner script. I kept different version for learning purposes

**Made with Python 3.8.5 so it's working on Python 3**

### Legal notices

As the Nmap's legal page said : "The legal ramifications of scanning networks with Nmap [author's note: or any tool] are complex and so controversial that third-party 
organizations have even printed T-shirts and bumper stickers promulgating opinions on the matter".

However – while not explicitly illegal – port and vulnerability scanning without permission can get you into trouble:
  - The owner of a scanned system can sue the person who performed the scan. Even if unsuccessful, the case can waste time and resources on legal costs
  - The owner of a scanned system can report the scanner’s IP to the associated ISP. 
  Many ISPs prohibit unauthorized port scanning. Some will take action – such as with reprimands or canceling of service
  
  **With that said, I cannot be made responsible if you have any problems after using this tool.**
  So use it with cautions or (this is better) with authorization from the owner's scanned device.
